# Project to Determine Risks in Aviation Based on Aircraft Accident Data

## Overview

A company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.


## Project Goal

1. To use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder who wants to venture into aviation business.
2. To determine determine which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. 
3. Translate findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Data

### Data Understanding

Data comes from Kaggle detailing <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses" target="_blank">Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023</a> provided by the National Transportation Safety Board 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.


### Data Analysis

I used 14 columns for my analysis which included:
1. The make of the aircraft
2. Model of the aircraft
3. Weather condition
4. Number of fatalities and survivors
5. Phase of the flight when an accident occured
6. Created a column for survival rate

### Findings

From my analysis:

1. Cessna, Piper and Peech Makes are the most accident prone aircrafts.
2. Most accidents happen under VMC weather conditions when the plane is in cruise mode.
3. Cessna and Piper aircraft models make up the top 20 aircrafts that have been involved in accidents.
4. Anchorage, Alaska tops in the number of accidents per location.
5. 1980's had the most fatalities yet.
6. Lockeed, Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, McDonnell and Bombardier offer the best survival rate for commercial passenger aircrafts i.e. aircrafts with 50 passengers and above.

Below are links for the vizualization of relationships between different metrics in the aviation accidents.

## Conclusion / Next Steps

Deep dive analysis need to be done to look at the finer details of some of the findings such as why Cessna and Piper are the most accident prone aircrafts.

All in all, the best bet for aircraft Make while starting a commercial passenger airline would be Boeing, Lockeed, Airbus, Embraer, McDonnell or Bombardier.
